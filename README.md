# Statistical_Analysis_With_Python

This project is a two-part statistical analysis conducted using Python. It focuses on:

- Latent Heat of Fusion Analysis:
  
  - A comparative study between two independent measurement methods (Method A and Method B) for estimating the latent heat of fusion of ice. The study involves:

  - Data visualization via boxplots

  - Hypothesis testing (t-tests, variance test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test)

  - Normality checks (QQ plots, Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov)

- Ozone Concentration Study (Rennes, Summer 2001)
  - An in-depth exploratory and inferential data analysis of air pollution data. The goal is to investigate how meteorological factors (temperature, cloudiness, wind, rain) impact ozone levels and to prepare for predictive modeling. This includes:

  - Reading and preprocessing ozone.csv

  - Univariate and bivariate statistical summaries (boxplots, histograms, pair plots)

  - Normality testing and transformation (log-scale)

  - Comparison of means and variances (Student, Welch, Fisher tests)

  -Rain vs. dry day ozone concentration comparison
